# Symbiflow Examples
This is an alternative Symbiflow Examples tool based on the efabless Silkflow utility.

# Setup
Get silkflow by following the setup instructions at https://github.com/efabless/silkflow.

Activate a silkflow-configured shell by typing: `bash --rcfile <INSTALL_DIR>/<FAMILY>/.rc`.

That's it! You can type make in the examples for testing.

# License
This code is a trivial accompaniment to Silkflow based on code from https://github.com/symbiflow/symbiflow-arch-defs.
